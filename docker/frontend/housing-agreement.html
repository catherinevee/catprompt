                                    <p>This agreement is for the full academic year and cannot be terminated by the student except as specifically provided in this contract. Students who withdraw from the University or are dismissed may be required to vacate University housing immediately.</p>
                                    <p>Room assignments are made without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status.

                                    <p>A housing prepayment of $450 is required to confirm your space. This prepayment will be applied to your Fall Quarter housing charges. Late payment fees of $50 will be assessed for payments received after the due date.</p>

University Housing Agreement - Academic Year 2024-2025

1. CONTRACT TERM AND OCCUPANCY

This Housing Agreement constitutes a binding contract between the University and the student for residence hall accommodations during the 2024-2025 academic year. The contract period begins with the official opening of residence halls for Fall Quarter 2024 and terminates at the official closing for Spring Quarter 2025, subject to the terms and conditions herein.

This agreement is for the full academic year and cannot be terminated by the student except as specifically provided in this contract. Students who withdraw from the University or are dismissed may be required to vacate University housing immediately.

Room assignments are made without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status. The University reserves the right to reassign residents when necessary for operational, disciplinary, or other administrative reasons.

2. FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS

All housing and dining charges are due according to the University's fee payment schedule. Students are responsible for the full year's charges regardless of actual occupancy, except as specifically provided for in the cancellation policy.

A housing prepayment of $450 is required to confirm your space. This prepayment will be applied to your Fall Quarter housing charges. Late payment fees of $50 will be assessed for payments received after the due date.

Students with past due balances may be subject to late fees, registration holds, and/or removal from University housing. The University reserves the right to increase housing rates for the following year with sixty (60) days notice.

All students living in residence halls are required to participate in a University meal plan. Meal plan charges are separate from housing charges and subject to their own terms and conditions.

3. BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS AND COMMUNITY STANDARDS

Residents must comply with all University policies, including the Student Code of Conduct, as well as federal, state, and local laws. Residents are responsible for the conduct of their guests and may be held accountable for guest violations.

ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES: The University maintains a drug-free campus. Possession or use of illegal drugs is prohibited. Alcohol policies vary by building and resident age, and must comply with state law and University regulations.

QUIET HOURS: Sunday through Thursday from 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM, and Friday through Saturday from 12:00 AM to 10:00 AM. During finals week, 24-hour quiet hours are in effect.

GUEST POLICY: Guests must be registered with front desk staff and may stay no more than three consecutive nights in any seven-day period. Overnight guests of the opposite gender are subject to roommate agreement and floor policies.

PROHIBITED ITEMS: Weapons, candles, incense, halogen lamps, space heaters, appliances with exposed heating elements, and pets (except approved service animals) are prohibited in all University housing.

4. CONTRACT RELEASE AND CANCELLATION

CANCELLATION BEFORE MOVE-IN: Students may cancel this agreement without penalty if written notice is received by July 1, 2024. Cancellations received between July 2 and August 15, 2024 will result in forfeiture of the $450 prepayment.

EARLY DEPARTURE: Students who leave University housing before the end of the contract period remain financially responsible for the full year's charges unless officially released through one of the following:
• Withdrawal from the University
• Completion of degree requirements
• Participation in approved study abroad or internship programs
• Documented medical or psychological hardship
• Marriage (if both spouses live off-campus)

CONTRACT VIOLATIONS: The University may terminate this agreement immediately for violations of University policy, non-payment of fees, or other material breach of contract terms. Terminated residents forfeit all fees paid and remain responsible for any outstanding charges.

All cancellation requests must be submitted in writing to the Office of Residential Life and include appropriate documentation. Processing fees may apply.

5. ROOM CONDITION AND MAINTENANCE

Residents will receive a Room Condition Report upon check-in and must note any existing damage within 72 hours. Failure to report pre-existing damage may result in charges for those damages upon check-out.

Students are responsible for maintaining their assigned space in clean and sanitary condition. Room inspections may be conducted for health, safety, and maintenance purposes with advance notice when possible.

DAMAGE CHARGES: Students will be charged for damages beyond normal wear and tear, including but not limited to: holes in walls, damaged furniture, excessive cleaning, carpet damage, and missing University property. Damage charges may also be assessed to all residents of a floor or building when responsibility cannot be determined.

MAINTENANCE REQUESTS: Students must report maintenance issues promptly through the online work order system. Emergency maintenance issues should be reported immediately to the front desk or Residential Life staff.

University staff may enter student rooms for maintenance, health and safety inspections, emergency situations, and when there is reasonable cause to believe University policies are being violated.

6. LIABILITY AND INSURANCE

PERSONAL PROPERTY: The University is not liable for theft, loss, or damage to personal property regardless of cause, including but not limited to fire, water damage, power outages, or acts of other persons. Students are strongly encouraged to maintain appropriate insurance coverage for personal belongings.

UNIVERSITY PROPERTY: Students are financially responsible for any damage to University property caused by the student or their guests. This includes damage to rooms, common areas, building exteriors, and equipment.

PERSONAL INJURY: The University's liability for personal injury is limited as provided by state law. Students participate in residence hall activities and use facilities at their own risk.

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES: Students must comply with all emergency evacuation procedures and safety regulations. Tampering with safety equipment (smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, exit signs) is prohibited and may result in immediate contract termination.

The University reserves the right to remove any student whose behavior is deemed detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of other community members.

7. ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

ROOM CHANGES: Room changes may be requested through the Office of Residential Life. Unauthorized room changes may result in additional charges and disciplinary action. The University may require room changes for operational, disciplinary, or other administrative reasons.

CHECK-OUT PROCEDURES: Students must complete proper check-out procedures, including scheduling a check-out appointment, removing all personal property, and returning all University property. Improper check-out may result in additional charges.

PARKING: Parking is not included with this housing agreement. Students must purchase separate parking permits and comply with all University parking regulations.

COMMUNICATIONS: The University will communicate with students through their official University email address. Students are responsible for checking email regularly and providing current contact information.

GOVERNING LAW: This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California. Any disputes arising from this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration or in the courts of Los Angeles County.

This agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties and may only be modified by written agreement signed by authorized University officials.
